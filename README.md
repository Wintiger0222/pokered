# Open Source Pokémon Red/~~Green~~/Blue Korean Translation Project

This is Open Source Pokémon Red/Blue Korean Translation Project.

This is based on pret's disassembly of [**Pokémon Red/Blue**][pokered] and [**Pokémon Yellow Korean Fan Translation**][pokeyellowkr] which I participated in as a programmer.
